# FIle_encryptor_and_hash_calculator

This simple script will encrypt a text file using simple substitution cipher. 
inputting the complete path to the file is recommended.  (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\file.txt)

moreover this script calculates hashes of the file and prints it in a hex digest.
available algorithms are MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256.
to hash the file input the complete path to the file (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\file.txt)
